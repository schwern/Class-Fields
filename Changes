Revision history for Perl extension Class::Fields.

0.07  Sat Feb 26 04:16:24 EST 2000
    - Forgot to require Exporter in a few places.  This got by somehow in
      5.005_03 but not 5.6.
    - base.pm now only loads other Class::Fields modules if field
      inheritance is happening.
    - altered tests slightly to fit new 5.6 diagnostics
